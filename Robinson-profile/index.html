                <p>I am an aspiring entrepeneur looking to expand my skillset. I am looking to get deeper into my passion and love for technology. I want to find a career that is flexible and fits me and my aspirations. Problem solving and being hands on is something I am ambitious about. Changing my life and having an experience I could've never dreamed of has always been my main goal. I am looking to explore and be free in my search of knowledge.</p>
                <p>I am a jack of all trades. I'd have to say my biggest superpower would have to be my adaptability. I love learning new topics and adjusting things to work in harmony. I won't allow tough situations to get me down. I will adjust and adapt what's necessary. Another key ingredient to my passion and drive is my resilience. Tough times create strong people.</p>
